Plays an alarm, do pushups in front of your webcam to stop it

Pushup tracking code is all from https://github.com/aryanvij02/PushUpCounter
I added a few lines to loop a sound

Run `python PushUpCounter.py <alarm_sound_file> <target_pushups>`
You can schedule it with cron or Windows Task Scheduler or whatever
Alarm sounds have to be in .wav
